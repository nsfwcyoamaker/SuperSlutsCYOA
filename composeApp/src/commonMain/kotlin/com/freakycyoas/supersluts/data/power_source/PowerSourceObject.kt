Your powers are not your own, they are tied to the item you choose. You will only be able to use your powers when you are wearing or holding your item. There is no need to worry about the item, it will be completely indestructible. If someone would steal your item they would only be able to use your powers at half of their strength. If people find out that your item is your power source you can expect people to want to steal it.
