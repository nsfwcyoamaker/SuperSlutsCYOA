Like you can hurt them really bad but you won’t be able to kill them and the same is true for you. Villains won’t actively try to kill superheroes, they much prefer to capture them alive and then rape the shit out of them. But shit happens you know, and l have spent way too much time on you to have you getting killed in some freak accident.")
