Take your time and think, you better not have any regrets.\n\nOk then, I'll send you on your way! But first I'll give you a special gift. I'm going to grant all of your team members, archenemy and anyone else you choose in the Fate section eternal youth and plot armor. Why? Because losing your friends and enemies is just really sad, like really sad. don't get how you mortals can stand being mortal. I shouldn't call you mortal since I kinda made you immortal, but you get the gist of it, ex-mortal. I'm already getting a bit sad right now... Having to say goodbye to you. You were really a zero when you came here, a total fucking loser and look at you now. I zapped you full of power and turned you into like the best hero ever. I'm so proud of myself! I'm totally not gonna cry, but if I don't send you off like right fucking now I'm totally gonna cry. You're not gonna ruin my makeup so bye bye!"),
